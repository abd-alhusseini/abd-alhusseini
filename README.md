## 👋 Hi, I'm Abdulrahman


I'm a passionate and ambitious network engineer from Saudi Arabia with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I thrive on designing, implementing, and securing network infrastructures. My hands-on experience with GNS3 and Cisco Packet Tracer allows me to simulate real-world scenarios, from complex routing protocols to robust security policies.
I am driven by a desire to understand how network components work together to create reliable and efficient systems. I am currently deepening my expertise in network security and automation to build the next generation of resilient networks.
